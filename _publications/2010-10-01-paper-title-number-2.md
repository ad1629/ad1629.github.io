excerpt: 'How are individuals confined in U.S. jails influenced by those with whom they are incarcerated? To measure such 'peer effects', we utilize novel cell-level data collected from a county jail in a large southern U.S. city. We leverage the fact that inmates are randomly assigned to jail cells conditional on their assignment to blocks within a jail floor. We use granular, daily cell-level location information and individual-level demographic and criminal history data from court records to identify the causal effects of peer characteristics on the behavior of individuals after they leave jail. Specifically, we use the day-weighted sum of cellmates' previous convictions as a measure of exposure. We find that a one standard deviation increase in exposure increases recidivism by 0.75 percentage points (1.8%). Investigations to see if these effects are intensified by the number of days the individual spends in jail and/or the prior criminal history of individuals return null results, implying exposure has a homogeneous effect on individuals. Additionally, we study if exposure to cellmates with certain types of prior criminal convictions (e.g., drug, property, sex, etc.) influences the types of crimes committed by individuals in the future. We find no consistent patterns that suggest individuals' crime-specific exposure influences their portfolio of future criminal activity. Notably, our estimates using our preferred specification---which rely on precise daily cell-level variation---are considerably smaller than those obtained when applying prior econometric frameworks---which rely solely on variation over time within an entire correctional facility.'
